{\bf \Large PHOKHARA version 6.0}

December 2006
\end{center}

\abstract{
Electron--positron annihilation into hadrons is one of the basic
reactions of particle physics. The radiative 
return~\cite{Zerwas,Binner:1999bt} 
offers the unique possibility for a measurement of this quantity over 
a wide range of energies.
The large luminosity of present $\phi$- and $B$-factories easily 
compensates for the additional factor of $\alpha$ due to the 
emission of a hard photon.
PHOKHARA is a Monte Carlo event generator which simulates this process
at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. 
Versions~1.0 and~2.0 were based on a NLO
treatment of the corrections from initial-state radiation (ISR). 
Those are independent of the final-state channel. 
Version~3.0 incorporates NLO corrections to final-state radiation (FSR) 
for pion pair production. Version 4.0 of PHOKHARA  
includes nucleon pair production  and NLO corrections 
to FSR for muon pairs.
PHOKHARA version 5.0
included $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ and kaon pair ($K^+K^-$ and $K^0\bar K^0$)
production as new channels, and radiative $\phi$ decay contributions 
to the reaction $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$. Version 
5.1 of PHOKHARA introduces minor improvements with respect to 
the version 5.0.
In the newest version 6.0 the reaction
 $e^+e^-\to \Lambda (\to \pi^- p) \bar \Lambda (\to \pi^+ \bar p)\gamma$
 (in LO approximation) was
added. The $\Lambda$- and $\bar\Lambda$-spin dependence and the
correlation among their decay products is included \cite{Czyz:2007wi} .

\section{Introduction}

The first version of the Monte Carlo event generator 
(PHOKHARA version 1.0~\cite{Rodrigo:2001kf})
incorporates ISR only at NLO~\cite{Rodrigo:2001jr}, 
with $\pi^+\pi^-\gamma(\gamma)$ and 
$\mu^+\mu^-\gamma(\gamma)$ as final states, and was designed to 
simulate configurations with photons emitted at relatively large 
angles, $\theta^2 \gg m_e^2/s$. 
Its second version (PHOKHARA version 2.0~\cite{Czyz:2002np}) 
extends the validity of the program into the small angle 
region~\cite{Kuhn:2002xg,Rodrigo:2001cc}, 
incorporates FSR at leading order (LO) for $\pi^+ \pi^-$ and 
$\mu^+ \mu^-$ final states, and includes four-pion final states 
(without FSR) in the formulation described in detail in~\cite{Czyz:2000wh}.

The third version of the generator (PHOKHARA version 3.0~\cite{Czyz:2003np}),
allows simultaneous emission of one photon from the initial state 
and one photon from the final state, requiring only one of them to 
be hard. This includes in particular the radiative return
to $\pi^+ \pi^- (\gamma)$ and thus the measurement of the (one-photon) 
inclusive $\pi^+ \pi^-$ cross section. 
The influence of collinear lepton pair radiation has
been investigated in \cite{Ustron_03_N,Ustron_05_N}.

Recent experimental results indeed demonstrate the power
of the method and  indicate that a precision of one per cent
or better is within reach.
In view of this progress a further improvement of our theoretical 
understanding seems to be required. 
To meet that requirements
PHOKHARA version 4.0~\cite{Nowak,Czyz:PH04}),
introduced production of nucleon pairs (proton-antiproton and 
neutron-antineutron) as new channels, and FSR for muon pair 
production at NLO. Some improvements were also incorporated 
to better describe FSR at NLO for pion pair production. The 
effect of photon vacuum polarization was also implemented.

PHOKHARA version 5.0 (and 5.1) was a continuation of that
effort. New hadronic channels were
introduced, mainly $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ 
and kaon pairs ($K^+K^-$ and $K^0\bar K^0$) \cite{Czyz:2005as}, and
in addition the radiative $\phi$ decay contributions 
to the reaction $e^+e^-\to\pi^+\pi^-\gamma$ was incorporated
\cite{Czyz:2004nq} to improve
description of that process when running at $\phi$-factory (DAPHNE)
energy. The old parameterization of 
the pion form factor \cite{Kuhn:1990ad} was changed to one based
on a dual resonance model \cite{Khodj04}. The new form factor
is supposed to describe data up to $Q^2\sim$ 10 GeV$^2$
(although very recent experimental results \cite{Pedlar:2005sj}
seem to indicate that the rate
is still underestimated for large $Q^2$). 
The vacuum polarization was taken from \cite{Jeg_web}, however
the contributions from narrow resonances
($\phi,J/\psi$ etc.), which should be parameterised
separately, were taken out from
the original code. Linear interpolation of the 'continuum'
contribution is used instead in the region of narrow resonances,
which were reintroduced as additional separate contributions
(only $\phi$ for muon and pion pair production 
in the present version). Many additional
aspects of the radiative return and PHOKHARA Monte Carlo event generator
was discussed in \cite{proc}. Version PHOKHARA 5.1 introduces 
some improvements with respect to version 5.0 (details of the models of the
 radiative $\phi$ decays were changed).
In the newest version 6.0 the reaction 
$e^+e^-\to \Lambda (\to \pi^- p) \bar \Lambda (\to \pi^+ \bar p)\gamma$ 
(in LO approximation) was
added. The $\Lambda$- and $\bar\Lambda$-spin dependence and the
correlation among their decay products is included \cite{Czyz:2007wi}.

following web address: \\ {\tt http://ific.uv.es/$\sim$rodrigo/phokhara}

\section{Input file}

The interaction of the user with the program is made through the 
file {\bf input\_6.0.dat}. It defines some physical constants and the 
specific parameters needed for the generation.
The values of these parameters can be changed by the user.
Some new variables have been included.

\begin{itemize}
\item[]{{\tt nges} -- number of events which shall be generated. The number 
of events accepted and returned in the output file depends on the 
kinematical constraints, the energy of the collision and the 
generated final state. Typically, the acceptance rate varies 
between $30\%$ and a few per cent.}

\item[]{{\tt nm} -- number of events used to scan the integrand and find 
its maximum. A preliminary scan is maid to find the maximum(s) of the 
integrand(s) before the true generation starts. 
The value of the maximum used in the generation phase is slightly 
greater than this approximated maximum.}

\item[]{{\tt outfile} -- name of the output file where the four-momenta 
of the particles of the accepted events are stored.}

\item[]{{\tt iprint} -- whether the four-momenta of the generated events
is printed ({\tt iprint=1}) or not ({\tt iprint=0}) through 
subroutine {\tt writeevent} in the output file {\tt outfile}.}

\item[]{{\tt nlo} -- whether the program should provide predictions at 
LO ({\tt nlo=0}) or NLO ({\tt nlo=1}).}

\item[]{{\tt w} -- energy cutoff of soft photon emission, normalized 
to the centre-of-mass energy. The physical result is independent of its
value. Recommended value $w=10^{-4}$.}

\item[]{{\tt pion} -- which final state channel shall be simulated: 
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{{\tt pion=0} : $\mu^+\mu^-$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=1} : $\pi^+\pi^-$} 
\item[]{{\tt pion=2} : $2\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=3} : $2\pi^+2\pi^-$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=4} : $p\bar{p}$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=5} : $n\bar{n}$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=6} : $K^+K^-$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=7} : $K^0\bar K^0$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=8} : $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$}
\item[]{{\tt pion=9} : $\Lambda (\to \pi^- p) \bar \Lambda (\to \pi^+ \bar p)$}
\end{itemize}}

\item[]{{\tt fsr} -- only ISR is simulated ({\tt fsr=0}),
FSR is included at LO without ISR--FSR interference ({\tt fsr=1})
or with ISR--FSR interference ({\tt fsr=2}).
The ISR--FSR interference is included only when the program is 
running in LO mode.}

\item[]{{\tt fsrnlo} -- includes ({\tt fsrnlo=1}) or not 
({\tt fsrnlo=0}) simultaneous emission of one photon from the initial 
state and one photon from the final state, and the corresponding 
virtual corrections. Only in the two-pions, two charged kaons
 and two-muons modes.}

\item[]{{\tt ivac} -- vacuum polarization on ({\tt ivac=1}) or 
off ({\tt ivac=0}).}

\item[]{{\tt tagged} -- at least one photon is tagged ({\tt tagged=0}) 
inside the angular region defined by the angular cuts {\tt phot1cut} 
and {\tt phot2cut}. In the untagged mode ({\tt tagged=1}), the 
hadrons are tagged and the angular and energy cuts are applied on the
missing energy-momentum.}

\item[]{{\tt FF\_Pion} -- choice between Breit-Wigner parameterisation
 of the pion form factor:
   K\"uhn-Santmaria parameterisation ({\tt FF\_Pion=0}) or
 Gounaris-Sakurai parameterisation ({\tt FF\_Pion=1}) 
 }
\item[]{{\tt f0\_model} -- three different models for radiative $\phi$-decays:
  KK model \cite{Czyz:2004nq} ({\tt f0\_model=0}),
  no structure \cite{Czyz:2004nq} ({\tt f0\_model=1}),
  radiative $\phi$-decays not included ({\tt f0\_model=2}),
  Cesare Bini (KLOE) - private communication ({\tt f0\_model=3}).
}

\end{itemize}



The remaining set of parameters defines the specific experimental settings:
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{{\tt E} -- centre-of-mass energy (GeV).}

\item[]{{\tt q2min} -- minimal squared invariant mass of the system formed 
by the hadrons and the tagged photon (GeV$^2$).}

\item[]{{\tt q2\_min\_c} -- minimal squared invariant mass of the 
hadronic/muonic system (GeV$^2$).}

\item[]{{\tt q2\_max\_c} -- maximal squared invariant mass of the 
hadronic/muonic system (GeV$^2$).}

\item[]{{\tt gmin} -- minimal energy of the tagged photon (GeV).}

\item[]{{\tt phot1cut} -- lower cut on the azimuthal angle of the tagged photon
(degrees).}

\item[]{{\tt phot2cut} -- upper cut on the azimuthal angle of the tagged photon
(degrees).}

\item[]{{\tt pi1cut} -- lower cut on the azimuthal angle of the muons 
or hadrons 
(degrees).}

\item[]{{\tt pi2cut} -- upper cut on the azimuthal angle of the muons 
or hadrons 
(degrees).}
\end{itemize}
All the kinematical cuts are given in the centre-of-mass system of 
the initial particles. The azimuthal angles are 
defined with respect to the positron momentum.

The program offers the possibility of presenting various differential 
distributions as histograms.
If this option is used, the name of the output file where the histograms 
are stored and the attributes of each histogram must be given.
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{{\tt title(i)} -- title of histogram {\tt i}}
\item[]{{\tt xlow(i)} -- lower edge in x for histogram {\tt i}}
\item[]{{\tt xup(i)} -- upper edge in x for histogram {\tt i}}
\item[]{{\tt bins(i)} -- number of bins for histogram {\tt i}}
\end{itemize}
where {\tt i=1,$\dots$,20}. 

\item
The file {\tt
const$\underline{\,\,}$and$\underline{\,\,}$model$\underline{\,\,}$param.dat}
contains all constants and parameters (up to version 5.0 initialized in 
 subroutine input or given in the 
 input file discussed above), specific for models of the hadronic currents.

First set of parameters defines physical constants: coupling
constants, masses, and decay widths. The following values are used
by default:  
\begin{itemize}
\item[]{$1/\alpha$ = 137.03599911 -- fine structure constant}

\item[]{$m_e$ = 0.51099906 $\cdot 10^{-3}$ GeV -- electron mass}

\item[]{$m_{p}$ = 0.938271998 GeV -- proton mass}

\item[]{$m_{n}$ = 0.93956533 GeV -- neutron mass}

\item[]{$m_{\mu}$ = 0.1056583568 GeV -- muon mass}

\item[]{$m_{\pi^\pm}$ = 0.13957018 GeV -- charged pion mass}

\item[]{$m_{\pi^0}$ = 0.1349766 GeV -- neutral pion mass}

\item[]{$m_{K^\pm}$ = 0.493677 GeV -- charged kaon mass}

\item[]{$m_{K^0}$ = 0.497672 GeV -- neutral kaon mass}

\item[]{$m_{\Lambda}$ = 1.115683 GeV -- lambda mass}

\end{itemize}
For the parameterization of the form factors
more constants are needed and their values are explicitly given
 in the subroutine {\tt input} and are set by the user, if he wants
 to modify the default values, by changing the appropriate values
 in the file
 const$\underline{\,\,}$and$\underline{\,\,}$model$\underline{\,\,}$param.dat .
 


\section{Output}

PHOKHARA presents the output information in several forms and 
saves it in different files. 

The four-momenta of the particles of the accepted events are stored in 
the file given by {\tt outfile}. The format of the output is 
determined by the subroutine {\tt writeevent(pion)} and can be changed 
by the user. All the momenta are given in the centre-of-mass system of 
the colliding electron and positron. 

The subroutine {\tt inithisto} books the histograms being based on 
the information given by the input file. The subroutine 
{\tt endhisto} fills the histograms at the end of the 
generation run and save the result in the output file. 
The histogram 
information is stored in the intermediate steeps of the calculation 
in the matrix {\tt histo(i,j)}, where {\tt i} identifies the histogram 
number and {\tt j} the bin and
the user can use its favourite histograming 
tool simply modifying the subroutines {\tt inithisto}
and {\tt endhisto}, where the initialisation and filling the histograms
 take place.

By default only the $Q^2$ distribution, where $Q^2$ is the squared 
invariant mass of the hadronic (muonic) system, is calculated. 
The contribution from single photon events is stored in histogram 
{\tt 1}. The contribution from two photon events is stored in 
histogram {\tt 2}. The final $Q^2$ distribution is given 
by the sum of both results. Other differential distributions
can be defined though the subroutine {\tt addiere(wgt,qq,i)},
where {\tt wgt} is the weight of the event, {\tt qq} is the 
value of $Q^2$ and {\tt i} is equal to 1 for single photon events 
and 2 for two photon events. The four-momenta of the events are
given by the matrix {\tt momenta(i,0:3)}, where {\tt i=1,$\ldots$,7}, 
for the positron, the electron, the two real photons (for single 
photon events {\tt momenta(4,0:3)} is set to zero), 
the virtual photon converting into hadrons, 
the $\pi^+ (\mu^+, \bar{p}, \bar{n}, K^+,  K^0)$
and $\pi^- (\mu^-, p, n, K^-,\bar K^0)$ respectively.
In the three pion channel {\tt i=6,7,8} for the $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$ respectively
 and in the four pion channels
{\tt i=6,$\ldots$,9}  for the $\pi^0\pi^0\pi^-\pi^+$
and $\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-\pi^+$ respectively. In the 
$\Lambda (\to \pi^- p) \bar \Lambda (\to \pi^+ \bar p)$
channel {\tt i=8,$\ldots$,11} for the $\pi^+ \bar p \pi^- p$ respectively.
 For technical reasons the {\tt i=6,7} correspond to $\bar \Lambda\Lambda $ 
 respectively.
This matrix can be used by the user to define other
 differential distributions. 

At the end of the run, PHOKHARA displays also the total number of 
accepted events, the value of the cross section, the value of the 
scanned maximum(s) and the biggest value of the integrand(s) found 
during the Monte Carlo generation. The last should be always smaller
than the scanned maximum. If during the generation a value of 
the integrand is found to be bigger than the scanned maximum,
a warning is given. Then, the number of events used for the initial 
scan should be increased.
